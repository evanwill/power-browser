One fascinating aspect of the web is that everyone must share code to participate.
You send a request to a server, they send back some code.
Your browser is not a black box--you can always peek under the hood!

{% include figure.html img="sai-kiran-anagani-61187-unsplash.jpg" alt="code" width="65%" %}

**Right click** on any web page and select "**View page source**" to see the code that is being rendered by the browser (shortcut: `Ctrl + U`). 

Or put `view-source:` in front of any URL in your address bar, for example:

`view-source:https://evanwill.github.io/web-crash-course/`

This is HTML!
