## Places to Create Your Own Site

Creating a website of your own is a great way to learn--and it is just fun to own a piece of the internet!
Here are options with free accounts that are good for learning:

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) - the worlds most popular Content Management System, originally designed to create blogs, WordPress now powers more than 40% of the web. Getting to know WordPress is definitely a good transferrable skill to add to your resume. It is relatively easy to get started (you won't have to write code) and has a powerful theme system.
- [W3Schools Spaces](https://www.w3schools.com/spaces/) - create simple static sites in your browser, integrated into a learning platform.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - the popular code repository service GitHub provides free static hosting. This great if you use GitHub or want to share or collaborate on your code. Learn more in the [Go Go GH-Pages workshop](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages-b/).
