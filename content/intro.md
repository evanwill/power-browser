The web often seems like magic!
Or some matrix mystic reality bending stuff...

However, the internet is created by normal human beings (*mostly*) and powered by physical devices just like your personal computer.

This workshop seeks to introduce the concepts and mechanics that power the internet to demystify them and start building a more critical understanding of web technology.
The web is dominated by a few big tech companies, but you don't have to be a passive consumer--> you can use savvy digital literacy skills to evaluate information, discover what you want, and create on the web yourself.
