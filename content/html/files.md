No matter how fancy the site, ultimately what your browser is receiving from the server is just a few different file types: 

- <span class="term">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</span> provides the structure and content
- <span class="term">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</span> provides the style
- <span class="term">JS (JavaScript)</span> provides the interactivity
- (plus any media files such as images, audio, or video)

In fact, you can write some web code--we are going to do it right now!
