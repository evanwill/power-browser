The web, internet, and cloud sound like ethereal places of the mind. 
However, they are physical things.

A network is two or more computers connected. 
The <span class="term">internet</span> is network of networks.
So basically, the web is a bunch of computers hooked up with a bunch of wires!

The websites we browse come from <span class="term">Web Servers</span>.
Servers are specialized computers that run software to host files and web services.
They have processors, memory, hard drives, and network ports just like your computer--in fact you can use your laptop or a Raspberry Pi as a simple server--however, they are designed to pack into racks to maximize use of space and optimized for processing requests.
